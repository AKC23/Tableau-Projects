## 📊 About the Dashboard

This interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes the prevalence of gender-based violence across Bangladesh based on the **Violence Against Women (VAW) Survey 2024**. It provides insights into both lifetime and recent experiences of:

- **Non-Partner Violence (NPV)**

The data is disaggregated by region (8 divisions), revealing regional disparities and highlighting areas of high vulnerability.

## 🗺️ Key Visualizations

- **📊 Division-wise Breakdown:** Comparative views of violence types over time  
- **📉 Recent vs Lifetime:** Trends in physical, sexual, emotional, controlling, and economic abuse   

> The dashboard draws attention to **psychological violence** as the most prevalent form and spotlights the **increased vulnerability of adolescent girls** and **women in disaster-prone areas**.
